so learning regular-expression or regex
regex was basically an editor type thing for the early unix days
for standardization posix was introduced
  posix -- bre basic regular-expression
        -- ere extended regular-expression --used nowadays
the grep u use was actually  g for global and rep is for Regular-Expression and p for printing it 
.  - it means anything except newline. 
\ - backward slash it just nulls the effect of keywords
[] - it means character set anything inside it is included or excluded
[RC]- it will only match R or C 
you can make a range inside the character set by writing - sign
   [A-Z] it will select the char from A-Z.

so knowing about the tor - although i know a lil bit already
  Hide your IP address
  Bypass rate limits
  Avoid detection/blocking
  Simulate requests from different geographic locations (to some extent)

ðŸ§…How Tor Works (Conceptually)

    Entry Node: You connect to the Tor network through this node. knows only IP 
    Middle Node: Passes encrypted traffic to the next node. No knowledge of origin[IP] or destination
    Exit Node: The final node that connects to the destination server (e.g., the website you're visiting). The website sees the IP
    of the website hosted only; no knowledge of the origin.

By default, you get a new IP every 10 minutes or so.

SOCKS5 is a proxy protocol that routes your network traffic through a proxy server â€” in this case, Tor.
"SOCKS" = Socket Secure.SOCKS5 is a proxy protocol that routes your network traffic through a proxy server â€” in this case, Tor.SOCKS = Socket Secure.

Tor doesnâ€™t work like regular HTTP proxies (like http://proxyserver:port). It speaks SOCKS5, which is low-level and allows more control.Using SOCKS5 lets you:
    Anonymize your IP
    Route requests through Tor without changing DNS or the browser
