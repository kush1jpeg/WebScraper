so learning regular-expression or regex
regex was basically an editor type thing for the early unix days
for standardization posix was introduced
  posix -- bre basic regular-expression
        -- ere extended regular-expression --used nowadays
the grep u use was actually  g for global and rep is for Regular-Expression and p for printing it 
.  - it means anything except newline. 
\ - backward slash it just nulls the effect of keywords
[] - it means character set anything inside it is included or excluded
[RC]- it will only match R or C 
you can make a range inside the character set by writing - sign
   [A-Z] it will select the char from A-Z.
